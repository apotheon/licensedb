# LicenseDB

The Copyfree Initiative license database will be managed by an object-oriented
interface for ease of integration with web applications or other software, and
this will be that object-oriented interface.  At the moment, it is very much a
work-in-progress, and entirely useless for its eventual intended purpose.  It
does not even include a proper license database yet.
