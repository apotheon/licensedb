# LicenseDB

The Copyfree Initiative license database will be managed by an object-oriented
interface for ease of integration with web applications or other software, and
this will be that object-oriented interface.  At the moment, it is very much a
work-in-progress, and entirely useless for its eventual intended purpose.  It
does not even include a proper license database yet.

The sources for this project are hosted in a Fossil repository, though I also
maintain a GitHub mirror of it with the [FossGit][fossgit] tool.

* [Fossil Repository][fossrec]
* [GitHub Mirror][github]

Note: The location of the Fossil repository will change "soon".  It's obviously
more than a license DB, so it needs a name that reflects that fact.
